# Learnium 

This project aims to apply what I learnt so far from Robert Nystrom's excellent book [Crafting Interpreters](http://craftinginterpreters.com/) and add more features. Basically a rewrite of my previous lox implementation.
These include:
- Aim to properly structure a project in c
- Learn how to implement tests and write test cases.
- Have a fully functional programming language that can write real programs.
- Learn about build systems and have one that targets most platforms, Windows, MacOS, Linux.
